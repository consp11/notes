gpg --verify pgpfile
gpg --verify sigfile [datafile]
      Verify  the signature of the file but do not output the data un‐
      less requested.  The second form is  used  for  detached  signa‐
      tures, where sigfile is the detached signature (either ASCII ar‐
      mored or binary) and datafile are the signed data;  if  this  is
      not  given, the name of the file holding the signed data is con‐
      structed by cutting off the extension (".asc" or ".sig") of sig‐
      file  or  by  asking  the  user for the filename.  If the option
      --output is also used the signed data is  written  to  the  file
      specified by that option; use - to write the signed data to std‐
      out.
